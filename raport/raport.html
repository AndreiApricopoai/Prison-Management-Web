        Detention Admin is a web application for the management of visits benefiting persons sentenced to the execution of a sentence in a penitentiary or a house of correction. Because of this application the detention facility can get statistics of all the visits made in the institution.

      <p property="text">
        Welcome to the introduction for the Detention Admin project. This project is designed to provide a user-friendly platform for scheduling visits to individuals who are currently incarcerated in correctional facilities. 
        The platform is built using HTML, which is the standard markup language used to create and design web pages.
        With Detention Admin, users can easily create an account, view available visitation slots, schedule a visit, and receive reminders about upcoming visits. 
        The system is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, while also incorporating important security features to protect the privacy and safety of both visitors and inmates.
